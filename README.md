# processSimulationInErlang

This repo is built mainly to satisfy the demands of Udacity-Machine Learning in PyTorch-Project 2.  So it isn't meant to be a 'real project'.  

Still, we are to investigate how Erlang can quickly allow us to simulate a process. Imagine simulating trade confirmation, portfolio allocation, etc,  
not the valuation/risk side, the life cycle aspects of portfolio management.  

We are to do this in Erlang...I don't know Erlang at all but reading about it
makes a compelling language to use for this type problems (beside can we move beyond Python :-)).

So here it is from scratch: 
--Let's just create a first scenario.  A portfolio manager is given 100,000 dollars to invest.  The portfolio policy is 30 percent stocks, 70 bonds.  
Our manager is given three days to properly execute the mandate.  

Right now, all of this is very vague. This README will be rewritten multiple times.  We don't even have UML diagrams or what not to guide us.  But let's code 
(I know, in real life this kind of attitude probably gets you shot).
